# nsharp - legacy

This is the initial N# Min to C# transpiler to bootstrap the [full N# project](https://github.com/defiant00/nsharp).

_**Warning** - Very hacky and only supports the features required to transpile Min as of 05/2022. This will not be updated, and may be entirely out of date compared to the current spec._
